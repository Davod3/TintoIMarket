----------------------------------------- TintoIMarket -------------------------------------------------

This project consists of a client-server type system named TintoIMarket.

Basically, TintoIMarket offers a service that allows users to purchase and sell wines, similar
to Vivino web application.

It maintains information about all registered users and their private messages (which can be sent 
from one user to another in this application), and maintains information about all wines: 
their value, classification and quantity, all made available by each user.

The application consists of two programs:

	- The TintoIMarketServer, which responds to all client requests;
	- The TintoIMarket client application, which communicates with the server through TCP sockets.

The application is distributed, as the server runs on one machine and there can be an unlimited
number of clients running on different machines on the Internet.

---------------------------------- HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION ------------------------------------------	

-------------------------------------------- SERVER ----------------------------------------------------

To execute the TintoIMarket Server, you can run the jar file TintoIMarketServer.jar with the 
following argument:

	TintoIMarketServer.jar <port>
	
	Where <port> refers to the TCP port number where to accept client connections.
	If you don't give any port, the server will use the port 12345 by default.

-------------------------------------------- CLIENT ----------------------------------------------------

To execute the TintoIMarket client, you can run the jar file TintoIMarketClient.jar with the 
following arguments:

	TintoIMarket.jar <serverAddress> <userID> <password>
	
	Where:
		- <serverAddress> identifies the server. The serverAddress format is the following:
			<IP or Hostname>:<port>. Server IP address or hostname is required and the port is optional.
			By default, the client connects to the server using the port 12345;
		- <userID> identifies the local user;
		- <password> refers to user's password.


Users can add wines, rate them, sell them, buy them, view them, get their balance,
talk to each other and read their unread messages.

Registered users must use the client application to interact with the server,
and must use this commands to make their requests:

	-> add <wine> <image> 			  - adds a new wine identified by <wine> and associated to the image <image> 
	-> sell <wine> <value> <quantity>  - puts up for sell <quantity> units of wine with the price <value>
	-> view <wine> 					  - gets the <wine> information
	-> buy <wine> <seller> <quantity>  - buys <quantity> units of wine to user <seller>
	-> wallet 				  		  - gets the current balance 
	-> classify <wine> <stars>		  - assign the classification <stars> (1 to 5) to wine <wine>
	-> talk <user> <message>			  - send a private message <message> to user <user>
	-> read							  - read new received messages

For each command presented you can use either the full word or the first letter of the command (e.g. a for add)
